# FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

## 1- What is money? 
It starts naturally (1) as a decentralised peer-peer agreement-language on what is valuable, for example.  
IF a group of individuals wants to barter together and they agree that 10fish=1chicken.  
AND 1fish=1seashell (for convenience 1fish can be represented by 1seashell).  
THEN seashells become a medium of exchange (currency) and a way to store wealth (money) for future use within that group.  
(1) Even children often develop their own money to exchange things with each other (marbles, candy, etc.)

## 2- What are the problems with modern money?
2.1. With time money becomes institutionalised, centralised, debt-based in fiat national currencies (backed only by the power governments give themselves to tax its people) which are controlled by governments banks organisations in their self-serving best interest. The natural p2p market economy is corrupted by inflation and interests and other shenanigans. This creates problems such as debts inequalities world-wars terrorism corruptions exploitations from continuously growing third parties (inflation interests fees commissions taxations (for wars armies armaments) etc.).

## 3- How can money be improved to make society better?
3.1. Returning to money by the people for the people. That means a system of decentralised peer to peer agreement (a language for money on what is valuable and can be used as currency for the exchange of goods and services and as money for storing value and investing).  
3.2. CC built on cryptology and the internet make money that is trans-national decentralised yet controlled and verifiable with complete traceability and an auditable database of all past transactions.  
This technology was invented by Satoshi Nakamoto and made public in his 2008 bitcoin white paper.   
It is a decentralised p2p-replicated public trust-less (crypto verified by 'miners' with trial and error (POW)) blockchain 
It was partly in response to the 2007-2008 worldwide systemic financial and real-estate crash.  
This crash left millions of people in debts and made banks even richer than they already were (because of questionable financial practices designed to transfer funds from the public to private entities).  
These practices included commercial banks engaging in investments banking which was the cause of the great depression and had been outlawed after the great depression by the Glass-Steagall act which was repelled in 1999 which then caused the 2007-2008 financial crisis. 

## 4- How to obtain CC? 
4.1. Charge for your products services in CC, exchange regular money for CC, mine it, get tipped in dogecoin.  
4.2. See appendix for details on exchanges.  
4.3. Beware of scams and hacks and illegal unregulated trades-exchanges and unethical operations (pre-mining).  
4.3.1. ex Mt.Gox (handled 70% of bitcoin exchange in Tokyo in 2013)). Tether (it is pegged to the USD which is illegal (in court following a subpoena in December 2017)). Bitfinex (second biggest hack of stolen bitcoin $72million on 2016.aug.02)

## 5- What can it be used for? 
5.1. Peer to peer vale exchanges of products and services (currency), store of value (money and investments)

## 6- How can it be safely stored? 
6.1. From the safest to least safe.  
6.1.1. Multiple cold paper wallets backed up and stored in several locations and protected from environmental damage (such as fire, water and UV) and printed from a computer never connecting to the internet and with a clean OS with only the paper wallet software installed from the original canonical (ex from the source code on a github which has been tested and peer reviewed for malicious software).  
6.2. Cold electronic wallet, Smartphone wallet, online wallet, exchange.  

## 7- What is a CC wallet? 
Reference (1) (bitaddress.org).  
A CC wallet is a single pairing of a CC public address (32 characters) with its corresponding CC private key (64 char.).  
QR codes are used to simplify the entry of the addresses.  
Below are 3 examples (among many other types) of bitcoin paper wallet (combination of public and private keys).  

Example 1 - A simple paper wallet with one Address and PrivateKey (each with their QR codes).  
Example 2 - A fancier paper wallet with one Address and PrivateKey (each with their QR codes).  
Example 3 - CSV Comma Separated Values: Index,Address,PrivateKey.  
(DO NOT USE THE FOLLOWING WALLETS THEY ARE NOT MONITORED).

Notes: these paper wallet have been impaired with red lines to prevent their use.  
This is a simple option but you can make your own public and private keys compatible with your chosen CC.  

## 8- How to protect a CC wallet? 
8.1. Print or record the address and private key.  
8.1.1. Backup the private key.  
8.1.1.1. (optional) download from github to check the authenticity by matching the SHA256 hash of the HTML with the SHA256 hash available in the signed version history document linked on the footer of this site.).  
8.1.2. Your private key is a secret do not share it is not public. Whoever you share your private key with can then access and spend all the CC at that address.  
8.1.3. Your paper wallet is like cash.  
8.2. Add funds to your wallet by asking for CC to be sent to your CC address.  
8.3. Your balance can be verified on your smart phone or on blockchain.info or blockexplorer.com by scanning or typing or entering your CC address.  
8.4. Risks.  
CC stored on a device are lost if you lose it so you MUST back it up and keep it safe offsite or online and remember your backup location and password. Payments are irreversible (CC sent into the void are lost forever). If you uninstall a wallet you must transfer its funds beforehand. When you delete a CC wallet the wallet's transactions and funds become inaccessible. If an active online wallet needs to be deleted you must first transfer its fund in another wallet such as a cold storage paper wallet. You should then inform whoever will inherit your money when you pass away about the wallet location and secret key otherwise all funds will remain in the wallet forever and never accessible or usable so they will be lost for your posterity. 
Only install apps you fully trust, malicious apps could be trying to steal your funds.  
Only keep on your smart phone a small reasonable amount for your routine use and keep your main investments offline.  
If you have an important amount or CC you should transfer it in cold storage (paper wallet backed up and kept in safe and different location) that is how CC investors keep their funds.  

## 9- How to spend CC? 
9.1. go to blockchain.info.  
9.2. scan the balance of your private key into your account or.  
9.3. store your funds on your smartphone wallet (bitcoin litecoin ether dash dogecoin) to be spent later.
